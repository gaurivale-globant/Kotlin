Some APIs initiate long-running operations (such as network IO, file IO, CPU- or GPU-intensive work, etc)
and require the caller to block until they complete. Coroutines provide a way to avoid blocking a thread and
replace it with a cheaper and more controllable operation: suspension of a coroutine.
